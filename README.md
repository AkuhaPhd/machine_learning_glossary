# Clustering Models 
This GitHub branch features Python implementations of various clustering models. Clustering models are unsupervised learning algorithms used to group similar data points together based on certain characteristics. Explore the following clustering models implemented in Python.

## Models Implemented
- **K-Means Clustering:** K-Means clustering partitions data into k clusters based on the mean value of the data points in each cluster. It is efficient and widely used for various applications.
- **Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering:** Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering builds clusters by iteratively merging the closest clusters. The result is a tree-like hierarchy of clusters, known as a dendrogram.

## Implementation Languages
Python: Implementations leverage common Python libraries such as NumPy, Scikit-learn, and others.

## How to Use
- Update the load data section of the code to fit your dataset.
- Install the required dependencies using the following command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run the desired clustering model module in your Python environment.

Feel free to explore and utilize these clustering models for your unsupervised learning tasks. If you encounter any issues or wish to contribute, please follow the guidelines provided in the repository. Happy clustering!
