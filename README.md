# Classification Models Implementation
This branch houses Python implementations of various classification models, essential for predicting the category or class of input data based on multiple features. Each model serves a distinct purpose and excels in different scenarios.

## Models Implemented
### Linear Classifiers
- **Logistic Regression:** Is a fundamental classification algorithm that models the probability of an instance belonging to a particular class.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier:** Support Vector Machines are powerful algorithms used for classification and regression tasks. In this implementation, SVM is utilized for classification.

### Non-linear Classifiers
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** K-Nearest Neighbors is a simple yet effective algorithm that classifies data points based on the majority class of their k-nearest neighbors.
- **Kernelized SVM (K-SVM):** Kernelized SVM extends traditional SVM by using kernel functions to map input data into higher-dimensional spaces, allowing for more complex decision boundaries.
- **Decision Tree Classifier:** Decision Trees make decisions by splitting the dataset based on features, forming a tree-like structure. This implementation is tailored for classification tasks.
- **Random Forest Classifier:** Random Forest is an ensemble method that constructs a multitude of decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes as the prediction.
- **Naive Bayes:** Naive Bayes is a probabilistic algorithm based on Bayes' theorem. It is particularly useful for text classification and spam filtering.

## Implementation Languages
Python: Implementations leverage popular Python libraries such as NumPy, Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

## How to Use
- Update the load data section of the code to fit your dataset.
- Install the required dependencies using the following command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run the desired model module in your Python environment.
