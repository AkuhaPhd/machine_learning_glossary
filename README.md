# Regression Models
This repository contains implementations of various predictive regression models. 
Predictive regression models are used in statistics and machine learning for predicting a continuous outcome variable 
(dependent variable) based on one or more predictor variables (independent variables). 
Here, you'll find different types of predictive regression models implemented in Python programming language.


## Models Implemented
### Linear Regression Family
- **Simple Linear Regression:** A basic linear regression model with a single predictor variable.
- **Multiple Linear Regression:** A linear regression model with multiple predictor variables.
- **Polynomial Regression:** Regression with polynomial features to capture nonlinear relationships.

### Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- **Support Vector Regression (SVR):** Regression using support vector machines.

### Decision Tree Family
- **Decision Tree Regression:** Regression using decision tree algorithms.
- **Random Forest Regression:** Ensemble regression using multiple decision trees.

## Implementation Languages
- **Python:** Implementations using popular Python libraries like NumPy, scikit-learn, Pandas and Matplotlib.

## How to Use
- Update the load data section of code to fit your data.
- Pip install requirements.
- Run module.
