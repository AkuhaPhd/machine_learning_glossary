# Association rule Models 
This branch contains Python implementations of Apriori and Eclat algorithms for association rule mining. Association rule mining is a data mining technique that focuses on discovering interesting relationships and patterns within large datasets.

## Models Implemented
- **Apriori Algorithm:** The Apriori algorithm is a classic method for frequent itemset mining and association rule learning. It uses a breadth-first search strategy to discover frequent itemsets and generate association rules based on their support and confidence.

- **Eclat Algorithm:** The Eclat algorithm is another widely-used algorithm for discovering frequent itemsets. It employs a depth-first search strategy and is known for its efficiency in memory usage.

## Implementation Languages
Python: Implementations leverage common Python libraries such as NumPy, Scikit-learn, and others.

## How to Use
- Update the load data section of the code to fit your dataset.
- Install the required dependencies using the following command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run the desired association model module in your Python environment.
